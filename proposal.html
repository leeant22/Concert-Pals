        <p>
        <section class="purpose">
            We intend to create an app that allows users to match with others to attend concerts or events together. The
            goal is to allow users to connect with others who have similar interests so they can enjoy live events
            together. The problem that many event-goers face is that they lack friends who share the desire to attend
            the same events due to differing interests. Event goers have to actively seek out concert buddies through
            their own personal connections. This would open up opportunities to carpool for people within proximity with
            each other.
            Additionally, an information technology problem in this space is that event-goers lack a platform to connect
            with new people to attend events with. An app that matches users by interest will increase social
            interaction and make events more enjoyable, since persuading friends to go to events they may not be
            interested in may worsen the experience for everyone. Also, it would ensure that people going together have
            similar preferences for price range and seating.

            <h3>Current Solution</h3>
            One existing web app that attempts to solve these issues is <a
                href="https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/meetup/what-is-meetup/1/" target="_blank">Meetup</a>.
            Meetup is an online platform that allows users to explore upcoming events near them. However, Meetup
            cannot
            match users based on their
            preferences.
            It only allows users to join large groups rather than connecting users with specific individuals who
            plan to
            attend the same events.
            Another existing web app that attempts to solve these issues is <a
                href="https://www.eventx.io/event-web-app" target="_blank">EventX</a>,
            an event-focused web app that allows
            users to experience events virtually from anywhere in the world. However, EventXâ€™s connection feature
            only
            allows one-on-one connections which is limiting, and does not offer interest tags so users can determine
            whether this potential concert buddy is a good fit.
            There are also facebook groups for different communities, like UW or Seattle, but the various types of
            posts
            make it hard to filter through posts for concerts and live events.

        <h2>App Description</h2>
        <p>
            The main users of our app will be concert and event goers. This app will allow for community building and 
            foster connections between people with similar interests. For example, minority groups may set preferences
            that connect them with others of similar backgrounds. Additional features may be used to promote and
            celebrate diverse music cultures and events. 
            <section>
                <h3>Feature</h3>
                A small feature of the app would be the ability to filter users by music preference or interests for
                attendees of an event. Once a user has registered for an event, they may add themselves to the list
                of attendees and view others who also plan on attending the event. This feature is focused on assisting
                users in finding buddies whom they may have an easier time connecting with. Another feature would be to 
                create groups with people whom the user plans on attending the event with to create plans. Groups will
                allow for a shared platform for attendees to connect prior to the event. Another feature that will be
                to create new event listings. This provides users with more options to meet others and find event buddies.
