                <h3>Purpose</h3>
                    <p>
                        We intend to create an app that allows users to match with others to attend concerts or events together. The goal is to allow users to connect with others who have similar interests so they can enjoy live events together. The problem that many event-goers face is that they lack friends who share the desire to attend the same events due to differing interests. Event goers have to actively seek out concert buddies through their own personal connections. This would open up opportunities to carpool for people within proximity with each other. Additionally, an information technology problem in this space is that event-goers lack a platform to connect with new people to attend events with. An app that matches users by interest will increase social interaction and make events more enjoyable, since persuading friends to go to events they may not be interested in may worsen the experience for everyone. Also, it would ensure that people going together have similar preferences for price range and seating.

                <h3>Current Solution</h3>
                    <p>
                        One existing web app that attempts to solve these issues is <a href="https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/meetup/what-is-meetup/1/" target="_blank">Meetup</a>. Meetup is an online platform that allows users to explore upcoming events near them. However, Meetup cannot match users based on their preferences. It only allows users to join large groups rather than connecting users with specific individuals who plan to attend the same events. Another existing web app that attempts to solve these issues is <a href="https://www.eventx.io/event-web-app" target="_blank">EventX</a>, an event-focused web app that allows users to experience events virtually from anywhere in the world. However, EventX’s connection feature only allows one-on-one connections which is limiting, and does not offer interest tags so users can determine whether this potential concert buddy is a good fit. There are also facebook groups for different communities, like UW or Seattle, but the various types of posts make it hard to filter through posts for concerts and live events.

        <h2>App Description</h2>
            <p>
                The main users of our app will be concert and event goers. This app will allow for community building and foster connections between people with similar interests. For example, minority groups may set preferences that connect them with others of similar backgrounds. Additional features may be used to promote and celebrate diverse music cultures and events.

            <h3>Feature</h3>
                <p>
                    A small feature of the app would be the ability to filter users by music preference or interests for attendees of an event. Once a user has registered for an event, they may add themselves to the list of attendees and view others who also plan on attending the event. This feature is focused on assisting users in finding buddies whom they may have an easier time connecting with. Another feature would be to create groups with people whom the user plans on attending the event with to create plans. Groups will allow for a shared platform for attendees to connect prior to the event. Another feature that will be to create new event listings. This provides users with more options to meet others and find event buddies.

            <h3>Information</h3>
                <p>
                    The information that users will be able to view are a list of upcoming events and the profiles of other users. Profiles will contain information regarding a user's interests, upcoming events they plan on attending, favorite artists, favorite genres, and more. It will also provide a list of upcoming events that users can register for to connect with other attendees. Upcoming events will include information such as location, time, venue, and artists. In addition, when users form a group, they will be able to view basic information regarding group members.

            <h3>Why it is the Best Solution</h3>
                <p>
                    Our app will act as a solution to the problems detailed above by serving as a centralized platform for making connections. The features of our app, such as the filtering ability and the ability to create groups, will save people time and resources, promote community building, and simplify the process of attending events. This, in turn, enhances the overall event experience for users, making more enjoyable and socially fulfilling. The app’s focus on inclusivity and diverse connections ensures that individuals from different backgrounds can participate and benefit from the platform, fostering a sense of community and shared interests.
