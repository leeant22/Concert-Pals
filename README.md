# About
This is a webapp called Concert Pals. Our goal is to help concert goers meet others and have a good time together. The webapp provides ways to see upcoming events, find groups, and create new events for others to go to. Users are able to create profiles specifying their interests connecting them with others who have similar interests. We hope to make concert going more enjoyable and help connect individuals.

# Features
We allow users to fill out a form to create events, which will dynamically add the submitted event to the Home page. We also allow users to fill out a form to create groups, which will dynamically add the submitted group to the Groups page. We also have a feature, where the user can delete events from the Home Page and also filter through the events by month. On the Groups Page, groups can be filered through by event name.
